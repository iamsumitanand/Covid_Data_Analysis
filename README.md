# Covid_Data_Analysis
This project aims to analyse the spread of Covid-19 in its early days. It has been performed using Python and later visualised with the help of Tableau.
The data was initially taken from Kaggle but has been modified a bit. All the data files have been uploaded to the above repository.

Here is the final look of the Dashboard.
